This blog deals with intellectual property statistics and other data analyses in R. It was built using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package for R. The theme is the example theme from blogdown and was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

This project is a learning experience for me in making and maintaining a statical website, as well as R and statistical analyses. While I will try to present interesting analyses and code examples, the contents should be taken with a grain of salt, as I have little experience in the matters I deal with here.
