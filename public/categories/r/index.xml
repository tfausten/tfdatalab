      <description>Country dispersion in patent applicationsThe TPF database contains data on the country of origin of patent application (country of residence of the inventor(s) and country of the applying organizations). This allows for interesting investigations into country-specific aspects of innovative activity. In this post I will investigate the issue of country dispersion in patent data. Country dispersion is a measure of the degree of internationality of patent applications. According to Lee (2016), the country dispersion index is calculated as \[D = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^N S^2_{i}\] where \(N\) is the number of countries involved in a patent and \(S_i\) is the share of inventors located in country \(i\).</description>

      <description>I created this blog to illustrate some of my learning efforts in R programming. Studying R, I found it much easier to practice the language by applying it to real-world datasets instead of textbook examples. The first dataset I use for some experimentation is the OECD Triadic Patent Families Database. This dataset provides endless possibilities for quantitative analyses in the realm of innovation studies and intellectual property statistics.
What is the OECD Triadic Patent Families Database?</description>
